# README

This application has been created to practice my skills on Ruby On Rails.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version is ruby 2.6.3p62 (2019-04-16 revision 67580).

* Rails version is 5.2.6

At all, that's what i've been used to get started and proceed my application and studies. Contact me for any doubts.
